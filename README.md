# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Our team has paired up with V.Isualize to conduct an analysis of the Pyber ride-sharing data that compares several metrics between urban, rural, and suburban city types. The metrics of interest are the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total amount of fares($). After extracting this data, we also calculated the average fare per driver and rider. With our newly found averages, we created a data frame that includes all of the data we need for our analysis. After compiling the data, we used a series of resampling to create a line chart to show the total fares per week by city type. 

## Results

### Urban
Urban cities have the greatest total number of rides, drivers, and fares. They have a total of 1,625 rides, 2,405 drivers, and $39,854.38 in total fares. However, they have the lowest amount of fares on average per driver ($16.57) and ride ($24.53). The lower average can likely be attributed to the high volume of drivers who tend to travel shorter distances.

### Suburban
Suburban cities have 625 total rides and 490 total drivers. They have the second greatest total in fares with $19,356.33. The average fair per ride is $30.97 and the average fair per driver is $39.50. The average fair per driver in suburban cities is two times the amount of urban drivers.

### Rural
Rural cities have the least amount of rides (125), drivers (78), and total fares ($4,327.93). However, they also have the greatest average fare per ride ($34.62) and driver ($55.49).

Our visual displays the total fares by city type between January and April of 2019. From this chart, we can see that ubran cities generate a greater amount of total fares. Suburban cities generate the second highest amount of total fares and rural cities generate the lowest amount of total fares during this time period.

## Summary and Recommendations
Drivers within urban cities have a lower average fare per driver compared to drivers in other city types. Perhaps Pyber can look to restructuring their rates within urban areas to level out the average amount of fares for drivers within each city type.

Pyber can also calculate the total number of rides per driver to see how that may impact the average fares per driver. There are significantly more drivers within urban cities which may limit the opportunity for drivers within urban cities to complete more rides. To increase the average fare per driver, Pyber can look into limiting the amount of drivers within urban cities to increase the total number of rides and fares per driver.

Lastly, the data suggests that the average fare per ride in urban cities is less than those in other city types. Drivers within urban cities are likely to complete shorter rides that don't generate as much revenue as drivers in rural and suburan cities. Pyber can look into creating hotspots or special times within urban cities where rates are increased to increase the average fare per ride.
